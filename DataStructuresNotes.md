## Introduction
(_This notes pages covers the essentials of data structures. Resources provided by "Geeks for Geeks"_)

A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can accessed and updated efficiently.

A data structure is not only used for organizing data, but it is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures, that can be used in almost every program or software system.

## Classification of Data Structure
- **Linear data structure**: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements.
  - _Examples of linear data structures are arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, etc._
  - **Static data strucutre**: Have a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. _An example of this is an array_.
  - **Dynamic data structure**:
